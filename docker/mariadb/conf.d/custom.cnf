# A custom MariaDB configuration file
#
# Use this file to amend the configuration for the MySQL database that is built
# by Docker.
# Additional configuration files can be loaded by adding them to the directory
# that this file sits in. List such files to your .gitignore if they contain
# environment-specific configuration.
#
# The MariaDB/MySQL tools read configuration files in the following order:
# 0. "/etc/mysql/my.cnf" which loads up all other configuration files.
# 1. "/etc/mysql/mariadb.cnf" to set global defaults.
# 2. "/etc/mysql/conf.d/*.cnf" (e.g. this file) to set global options.
# 3. "/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/*.cnf" to set MariaDB-only options.
# 4. "~/.my.cnf" to set user-specific options.
#
# If the same option is defined multiple times, the last one will apply.
#
# One can use all long options that the program supports.
# Run program with --help to get a list of available options and with
# --print-defaults to see which it would actually understand and use.
